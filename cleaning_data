# What issues will you address by cleaning the data?

 There are many row in allsession table don't have data for the quantity ordered, so the querry attempts to fill posible quantity data by JOIN data from table analytics with the key vitsitor id, visit id, and unit price. For all the row that is NUll in productquantity, the quantity is got from unitprice collumn of puclic.analytics table.	In case both of the previous one is NULL, the quantity will be allsessions.totaltransactions/allsessions.	
 All product price will be assumed as the productprice column in public.allsessions column
 There is some row in the allsession table that have city in the wrong country, so country will be change for those row.
 Product category column in allsession table is unclear so it will be formated to only contain the category name
 Product price will be divided by 1,000,000
 A new view with cleaned data will be created
 Component of cleaned data in cleaned_data view
	visitid: the visit id
	visitorid: website visitor's id
	ordereddate: ordered date 
	productsku: id number of product
	productname: name of product
	productcategory: category of product
	productprice:	unit price of product
	productquantity: ordered quantity of product

Quality Assurance

-	If the quantity is still NULL or equal 0, don't select the row.  
-	All row with unidentified city and country will not be included in the cleaned data
-	Ordered date have to be before or equal current date
This  WHERE clause will be added to do the above tasks
WHERE		COALESCE(allsessions.productquantity,analytics.unitsold,CAST(allsessions.totaltransactionrevenue/allsessions.productprice	AS	int)) IS NOT NULL
		    AND	COALESCE(allsessions.productquantity,analytics.unitsold,CAST(allsessions.totaltransactionrevenue/allsessions.productprice	AS	int)) !=0
		    AND	allsessions.city != '(not set)'
		    AND	allsessions.city !=	'not available in demo dataset'
		    AND	allsessions.date <= current_date
