  
# Question 1: Which cities and countries have the highest level of transaction revenues on the site?**


## SQL Queries:
	--top 3 citis with higest revenue
	SELECT 	city	AS	city,
		country	AS	country,
		SUM(productprice*productquantity) AS	totalcity
	FROM public.cleaned_data
	GROUP BY	city, country
	HAVING	SUM(productprice*productquantity) > 0
	ORDER BY	SUM(productprice*productquantity)	DESC
	LIMIT 3;

	--top 3 countries with higest revenue
	SELECT 	country	AS	country,
		SUM(productprice*productquantity) AS	totalcountry
	FROM public.cleaned_data
	GROUP BY	country
	HAVING	SUM(productprice*productquantity) > 0
	ORDER BY	SUM(productprice*productquantity)	DESC
	LIMIT 3;


## Answer: The two queries calculated the higest revenue cities and countries by calculate the total revenue(productprice*productquantity) from all the 
 transactions in each city and country
## Answer table:
- Top 3 citis with higest revenue:	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nrMftZXLk5HFhYhVbZCBIe8WsZJ2bZxH/view?usp=sharing
- Top 3 countries with higest revenue:	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vMrauD8dOD99c6-4YIDWLf3klL7gKQV0/view?usp=sharing
	   



**Question 2: What is the average number of products ordered from visitors in each city and country?**


SQL Queries:

SELECT 	DISTINCT	city,
		SUM(productquantity)	OVER(PARTITION BY	city)/COUNT(DISTINCT	visitorid)	OVER(PARTITION BY	city) AS	avgproductbycity,
		country,
		SUM(productquantity)	OVER(PARTITION BY	country)/COUNT(DISTINCT	visitorid)	OVER(PARTITION BY	country) AS	avgproductbycountry
FROM	public.cleaned_data
ORDER BY	city

Answer:	Average number of products ordered from visitors in each city and country:	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1osUZB5lRot-ASERmtSFaqrIuSFGc7W_8/view?usp=drive_link
	Calculated by geting the total quatity of product ordered in each city or country and then dividing by the number of visitor


**Question 3: Is there any pattern in the types (product categories) of products ordered from visitors in each city and country?**


SQL Queries:

--To count number of transaction in each category in each city
SELECT	country,
		city,
		productcategory,
		COUNT(productcategory)	AS	totaltransactionpercategory
FROM	public.cleaned_data
GROUP BY	city,country,productcategory
ORDER BY	country,
			city,
			totaltransactionpercategory	DESC
;

--To count number of transaction in each category in each country			
SELECT	country,
		productcategory,
		COUNT(productcategory)	AS	totaltransactionpercategory	
FROM	public.cleaned_data
GROUP BY	country,productcategory
ORDER BY	country,
			totaltransactionpercategory DESC
;

Answer:	The first query generates a table with all the city, different category ordered from each city and the total number of products ordered for each of those categories. The second 	query generate a table with all the country, different category ordered from each country and the total number of products ordered for each of those categories. From there, we can 	see that most US city ordered most product in Apparel category, when some of the US city also ordered more product from Nest category; by contrast, there is no significant pattern 	for city in other country. And when looking at the table from second query, it shows that over 36% of the transaction in the US is in Apparel category, 32% of the transaction in 	the US is in Nest category, and all other categories only share a small percentage of transaction. Besides, there's no significant pattern recognized from other countries.

**Question 4: What is the top-selling product from each city/country? Can we find any pattern worthy of noting in the products sold?**


SQL Queries:

-- city and best-selling product
WITH	cte AS(
	SELECT 	country,
			city,
			productsku,
			productname,
			SUM(productquantity) AS	totalorderedquantity
	FROM	public.cleaned_data
	GROUP BY	country,
				city,
				productsku,
				productname
),
cte2 AS(
	SELECT 	city	AS	city,
			MAX(cte.totalorderedquantity) AS	maxtotalorderedquantity
	FROM	cte
	GROUP BY	city
)
SELECT		cte.country,
			cte.city,
			cte.productsku,
			cte.productname,
			cte.totalorderedquantity
FROM	cte
JOIN	cte2 ON	cte.city=cte2.city
WHERE	cte.totalorderedquantity=cte2.maxtotalorderedquantity

--	country and best-selling product
WITH	cte AS(
	SELECT 	country,
			productsku,
			productname,
			SUM(productquantity) AS	totalorderedquantity
	FROM	public.cleaned_data
	GROUP BY	country,
				productsku,
				productname
),
cte2 AS(
	SELECT 	country	AS	country,
			MAX(cte.totalorderedquantity) AS	maxtotalorderedquantity
	FROM	cte
	GROUP BY	country
)
SELECT		cte.country,
			cte.productsku,
			cte.productname,
			cte.totalorderedquantity
FROM	cte
JOIN	cte2 ON	cte.country=cte2.country
WHERE	cte.totalorderedquantity=cte2.maxtotalorderedquantity



Answer:	City and best-selling product:	https://drive.google.com/file/d/14fm9foWEOSihPfhU9weg2UCR04P2D2PN/view?usp=sharing
	Country and best-selling product:	https://drive.google.com/file/d/15-AiwcpODmhDjb78SrBf-EjGao8zq1Tk/view?usp=sharing
	These two queries calculated the total number of quantity ordered for each product, then filter out the product with highest sale for each city and country. There is no significant 	pattern spotted for the product sold




**Question 5: Can we summarize the impact of revenue generated from each city/country?**

SQL Queries:

-- city and revenue and ratio of city revenue over total revenue
SELECT	DISTINCT	city, country,
		CAST(SUM(productquantity*productprice)	AS	float(2)) AS	cityrevenue,
		CAST(SUM(productquantity*productprice)/(SELECT SUM(productquantity*productprice)AS	totalrevenue	FROM	public.cleaned_data)*100 AS float(2)) AS	revenueratio
FROM	public.cleaned_data	
GROUP BY	city,country
ORDER BY	revenueratio DESC
-- country and revenue and ratio of ccountry revenue over total revenue
SELECT	DISTINCT	country,
		CAST(SUM(productquantity*productprice)	AS	float(2)) AS	countryrevenue,
		CAST(SUM(productquantity*productprice)/(SELECT SUM(productquantity*productprice)AS	totalrevenue	FROM	public.cleaned_data)*100 AS float(2)) AS	revenueratio
FROM	public.cleaned_data	
GROUP BY	country
ORDER BY	revenueratio DESC



Answer:
The querry calculated the total revenue of each city and country, and the total revenue for the dataset, then calculated the ratio of revenue of each city over total revenue for the data set. From the result, we see that the US is accounted for near 89% of the total revenue, Irasel is about 5%, Autralia is just over 3% and the rest is less than 1%.The cites generated the most revenue are Mountain View, San Franisco and Sunnyvale which generates 14.9%, 14.7% and 13.2% respectively
